# Bouncing DVD Logo
A simple PyGame code to trigger you anxiety, watch that DVD logo hit the corners.

Created this because of boredom while waiting for game to install (and for lulz too kekl)

# Sample (too lazy to crop window)

Install Python, open command prompt or terminal, do `pip install pygame` then run `python dvd.py`

That's it ðŸ—¿ðŸ’€
